That's all for now though, goodbye!
Liverpool now move eight points clear of second-place Leicester, but crucially they extend their lead over City to nine points. The away side now have a lot of work to do going forward to close in on Liverpool in the league and this result might be looked back on as a crucial moment in the hosts' title push.
Well, Liverpool take the three points in a wildly entertaining title clash that lived up to its billing! The game started in frenetic fashion, as City were denied a penalty at one end, before Liverpool raced away on the counter-attack to take the lead through Fabinho's stunning strike from distance. While it did seem as though Alexander-Arnold handled the ball in the build-up to the goal, replays suggested that Silva might also have handballed it for City. The hosts pushed on after that breakthrough and quickly doubled their lead through Salah's header. The rest of the half then saw City squander many chances to halve the deficit. The second period opened with Liverpool extending their lead through Mane's powerful header at the back post, and from there it was difficult for City to recover. They eventually pulled a goal back through Silva's smart finish, but it was too late to truly worry Liverpool and the hosts held on for victory amidst a tempestuous ending.

Yellow Card
Manchester City
90' + 5' Jesus is booked after the final whistle amidst City players protesting vigorously towards the referee. 
90' + 4' FULL TIME: Liverpool 3-1 Manchester City
90' + 3' Liverpool are enjoying possession in the City half as time runs out for the away side to mount a comeback. 
90' + 1' Fernandinho attempts a cut flick over the top to Angelino near the byline, but Liverpool drop to hack clear the danger once again.
90' Four minutes of stoppage time are added. 
89' De Bruyne curls in a devious free-kick that's met by Rodrigo who heads it well over the bar. City's rescue mission is looking increasingly desperate now. 
88' It looks as though Gomez is now marking the rampant Sterling to try and limit the City attacks down that flank.
J. Gomez
Mohamed Salah
Liverpool
87' Salah makes way for Gomez as Liverpool add to their defensive contingent to try and hang on to their lead. 
86' Sterling has been City's main outlet in this half and every attack is going through him now. You sense that if they're to recover these two late goals the electric attacker will be at the heart of it.
84' The away side continue to push for a way back! Their latest foray ends with De Bruyne heading a deep cross from Angelino well over the bar. 
82' City appeal for yet another penalty! Sterling approaches Alexander-Arnold again before attempting a curling shot that strikes the defender's arm! The referee waves play on again, perhaps owing to the fact that the defender had his arms in a largely natural position. 
80' City almost score again! A sharp move sees Sterling race in behind Lovren and pass across the onrushing Alisson towards Jesus, but Van Dijk manages to get back and smuggle the ball clear.

79' Firmino is replaced by Oxlade-Chamberlain as Liverpool try and tighten up their defence.

Goal
Manchester City
78' CITY GET ONE BACK! Well, if it's the start of the comeback they've certainly left it late! De Bruyne beats Fabinho in the air to recycle possession out towards Angelino who fires in a low cross that Silva calmly slots beyond Alisson from 10 yards! 
76' Sterling shimmies past Alexander-Arnold again before losing control of the ball inside the box, with it ricocheting off Lovren and away for a corner that amounts to nothing. 
74' Andy Robertson angles through a clever pass to Milner inside the box, but Stones stretches to intercept just in time.
72' Mane is down with a head injury after Sterling innocuously caught him with his arm, however it looks as though the attacker will be okay to continue.  
Gabriel Jesus
S. Agüero
Manchester City
71' Aguero is replaced by Jesus after a profligate day in front of goal. 
68' City almost get one back! Another intricate move ends with Angelino drilling a cross along the six-yard box, but Aguero miscues his finish and fails to make contact, allowing Van Dijk to clear. 
66' Now it's Liverpool's turn to appeal for a penalty after Alexander-Arnold's mazy run is firmly halted just as he progressed into the box! However, the referee exercises consistency and waves away the appeals. 
Rodri Hernández
Yellow Card
Manchester City
65' Rodrigo is booked for some excessive protesting after the push on Sterling.
64' City howl for another penalty after Mane appeared to push Sterling from behind in the box, but once again, the referee and VAR remain unmoved.
63' Fabinho advances menacingly towards the City box once more and he lets fly again from 25 yards, but this time Fernandinho scurries across to block the effort. 
J. Milner
J. Henderson
Liverpool
61' Henderson is replaced by Milner as the hosts try and ensure that their energy levels don't drop in midfield. 
59' City can gather hope from the fact that they've only failed to score in six of their 62 Premier League away games under Pep Guardiola. However, two of those occasions have been against Liverpool and there's a real chance the hosts add to that today.
57' Liverpool win a corner, but City easily clear and begin a counter-attack that looks promising before Aguero's final pass is behind Sterling and Liverpool players flood back to stifle the move.
55' Well, it's going to be incredibly difficult for City to work their way back now. Even if they do commit more men forward in pursuit of a route back, they still have to contend with incisive Liverpool counter-attacks that could extend the lead.  
53' Sterling goes close again! The attacker's been so unfortunate today! This time he drives past Alexander-Arnold again, before entering the box and lashing a shot at goal that Lovren deflects inches over the bar!
J. Henderson
Assist
Liverpool
51' Liverpool hadn't even advanced into a dangerous area, they played a simple one-two from the throw-in before Gundogan backed off from Henderson, who angled in the perfect delivery for Mane! 
S. Mané
Goal
Liverpool
51' LIVERPOOL GET A THIRD! Gundgoan affords Henderson too much space on the right-wing and he flights in a cross from deep towards the back post, where Mane charges past his marker and powers a header beyond Bravo at the near post!
49' City's second corner of the half is worked short once more, but De Bruyne's eventual cross is claimed by Alisson.  
48' Sterling sizes up Alexander-Arnold on the left flank, before beating the defender and winning a corner. From the set-piece Liverpool clear to the edge of the area, where Gundogan has a shot deflected over. 
46' Liverpool get the second period underway.  
Looking ahead, City definitely aren't out of this game just yet - with a little luck they might not even be losing at half time! Nevertheless, they'll have to rely on De Bruyne to continue his spectacular display and hope that Liverpool's relentless energy dips in the second 45. 
Well, that first half was an amazing spectacle of end-to-end, attacking football! The game immediately started amidst huge controversy: at one end City were crying out for a penalty after what seemed to be a handball from Alexander-Arnold, before Fabinho drove home a stunning strike at the other. Replays did suggest that Silva may have handled in the build-up though, providing an explanation for the lack of intervention from VAR. Liverpool then doubled their lead, after a beautiful move that culminated in Salah heading home a pinpoint Andy Robertson cross. From there, City had plenty of chances to chip into the deficit through Sterling and Aguero but failed to make a breakthrough before half time.  
45' + 3' HALF TIME: Liverpool 2-0 Manchester City
45' + 2' Aguero manages to sneak one last effort on goal before half time, but his shot's tame and Alisson easily claims it. 
45' + 1' Salah lets a curling effort fly from 25 yards, but Bravo is equal to the shot and he manages to leap to his right and gather the ball. 
45' Wijnaldum dances through City's press, before passing to Firmino who plays Mane through on the left and it looks like a huge chance is opening up, before the attacker gets the ball caught between his feet and City clear. 
43' City miss another big chance! De Bruyne kickstarts another dangerous City break before threading Aguero clean through at an angle. The striker drives into the box before hammering a shot across goal from 18 yards that slams narrowly wide! 
41' Salah is down receiving treatment after a heavy, but fair, challenge from Fernandinho. It looks as though the Egyptian forward should be able to continue though. 
39' Walker - in true Alexander-Arnold fashion - dribbles deep into the Liverpool half before lashing a wild shot high and wide. 
37' Strong save from Bravo! Alexander-Arnold glides all the way from right-back towards the edge of the area before setting Firmino free inside the box, where the attacker has a powerful, low shot blocked instinctively by Bravo! 
35' Firmino wriggles elegantly into the area, before punting a shot comfortably over Bravo's bar.
33' Liverpool win a corner that Andy Robertson swings in, before Lovren glances an effort wide of the far post.
31' City can count themselves a little unfortunate to be two goals behind right now. They've managed four shots inside the box compared to Liverpool's two, with Sterling and Aguero in particular guilty of wasting opportunities.  
29' Angelino goes close for City! The away side work an intricate move that ends with Gundogan sliding Angelino in behind, who brushes off a challenge from Alexander-Arnold, before poking an effort from close range that Lovren deflects inches wide! 
27' This game's still being carried out in a reckless, end-to-end fashion! Liverpool initially almost get in behind through Salah down the right, before Angelino makes an interception, paving the way for De Bruyne to lead a breakaway that Van Dijk just about manages to contain. 
25' Great save from Alisson! Aguero cuts inside from the left before thumping a powerful effort at goal from just inside the box, that Alisson does brilliantly to palm away from danger!
23' City execute a well-worked free-kick that unleashes Sterling down the byline, but Van Dijk is able to hack it away for a corner and the hosts proceed to also fend off the resulting set-piece. 
21' Liverpool almost get a third! Mane and Andy Robertson combine expertly once more down the left-wing, before the latter drives in a low cross that Angelino slices just wide at the far post! That clearance could have gone anywhere!  
19' Part of City's troubles at the back so far could come from the fact that this defence has little experience of playing together. Fernandinho - who's usually deployed in midfield - has looked particularly uncomfortable so far.   
17' The away side nervously string together a long spell of possession as they try and stifle Liverpool - and the home crowd. 
15' City looked stunned as Liverpool swept through them there; this is reminiscent of many Anfield games where the hosts overwhelm their opponent early. City desperately need to settle and stem the tide if they're to take anything from this now.   
A. Robertson
Assist
Liverpool
13' It was a classic Liverpool attack! The two full-backs combined from each side of the pitch to stretch City's defence and engineer a simple chance for Salah to head home!
Mohamed Salah
Goal
Liverpool
13' LIVERPOOL SCORE AGAIN! 2-0! Alexander-Arnold executes a crisp switch of play out towards Andy Robertson on the left flank, who proceeds to swing in an early cross that Salah runs onto, before nodding a cushioned header beyond Bravo from close range! What a start for the hosts!
11' City almost equalise again! Another De Bruyne free-kick evades the Liverpool defence only for a stretching Aguero to miss out on a tap in by inches!
8' City go close! The away side almost respond immediately as Sterling latches onto De Bruyne's deep free-kick, only to nod wide from eight yards! 
7' Well, this has been an electric start! City were shocked not to receive a penalty and couldn't recover in time to adequately defend the Liverpool counter-attack. It'll certainly go down as a controversial talking point, as the ball did appear to glance off Alexander-Arnold's arm.
Fabinho
Goal
Liverpool
6' LIVERPOOL TAKE THE LEAD! What a strike! The hosts break rapidly while City are still howling for a penalty and Mane drives down the left flank before having a cross blocked out towards Fabinho, who fires a fierce drive into the top left corner from 25 yards! Bravo was left with no chance!
5' Bernardo Silva darts in behind Van Dijk before flicking the ball across goal to Aguero where Lovren intercepts. All the City players stop however and cry out for a penalty while the referee waves play on!
4' Liverpool have lost just once in their last 50 Premier League games - and it was against today's opponents. You get the sense that whoever claims victory today will feel fervently that they're the best team in the league. 
3' The away side force a corner, that De Bruyne swings in before Liverpool eventually clear after several attempts. 
2' City immediately win a throw-in deep inside the Liverpool half after Silva industriously chases down a long diagonal from kick off. 
1' Manchester City get us underway.
The teams are emerging from the tunnel and kick off is just moments away!
For the away side to get those crucial three points, they’ll need to overturn a troubling recent record at Anfield. City are winless in their last 16 Premier League away games against Liverpool, their longest such winless streak against an opponent in the competition’s history.
Liverpool make five changes from the side that beat Genk in midweek; they revert to what looks like their strongest team with Andy Robertson, Firmino and Mane all returning. City, meanwhile, make seven changes from their draw with Atalanta. Most notably, their goalkeeper Ederson is injured and misses out, meaning that Bravo will deputise after receiving a nervy red card in the previous Champions League fixture.
