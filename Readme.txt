EVENT DETECTION IN FOOTBALL

Steps to run the Code:
1). The code is written on Google Colab so the file has to be uploaded  on it and then opened. Then proceed on to run the code.
2). The training of the model requires images along with the information about which class it belongs to. This is given via a csv file which has the path of the image along with the category.
3). The dataset and the csv file should be uploaded on Google Drive.
4). The model is trained via CNN because it classifies the object boundary and shape which helps in classifying what types of objects are present in the image.
5). After training, the model is fed with a video to process.
6). The output video produced is nothing but the original video with events detected written on the top left of the frame.
7). The output video is saved in the Google Drive so you need to authorize and mount it in the Colab. The input video is also taken from Drive. So, the input video needs to be uploaded on drive first.
8). The output file can be found in Google Drive which has the events classified and shown.
